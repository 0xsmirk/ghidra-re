Create function signatures that can be shared amongst different projects. There
are multiple sets of signatures that are generated:

- Formal: Function matches entirely
- Fuzzy: Functions resemble each other in terms of data/call references.
- String: Functions contain same string references.
- Immediate: Functions match based on large immediate value references.

Formal signatures are applied first, followed by string, immediate, and fuzzy.
If a function is considered a match internal calls are also considered for 
renaming. 

## Apply
Apply Rizzo signatures from another project.
